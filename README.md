#AWHelper
The main idea was took from [CYHelper] (https://github.com/lancy/CYHelper.git).CYHelper is created by my friend Lancy,but he doesn't upgrad thie project since one years ago.
I am interested in CYHelper , so I want to code a Objective-C library like CYHelper. 

## Usage
Just add `AWHelper` to your project's Prefix.pch.Then you can use method that AWHelper provided conveniently in your project.
